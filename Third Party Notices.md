# Third Party Notices & Thank yous

We are extremely strong believers in thanking those who came before us for the hard work and dedication they have contributed to the community. While our libraries were written from scratch by our team we still want to thank the below libraries for inspiring us with our architecture.

The initial conception and need of this package and ground up library creation is inspired by some of the great open source work of other developers in the WAX Community and all around, This showed the clear need and want from the WAX community for a production SDK which we were more than happy to create via wax.labs, check them out below. We also have included any licenses to the relevant packages which you may find below.
